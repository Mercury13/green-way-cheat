# What is this?
A well-known Ukrainian traffic rules site has an achievement named “Faster than bullet”: complete exam in 30 seconds.

Ex-Soviet theory exam consists of 20 questions, so 1.5 s per question is inhuman. And someone answered in 15 s, 0.75 s per question! That’s why I decided to cheat too.

**This cheat is just for your own entertainment and will not give you any advantages except that achievement.** To get a driver’s license, you’ll still need to pass an exam at National Police, and if you cheat, you won’t know much. If some driving school uses that site for internal exam… better prepare, you’ll stil need to repeat that at police.

# How does it work?
Works as a Firefox add-on, tested at 60.0.2 x64.

To install, type **about:debugging** in address bar, then choose **Load temporary add-on**.

Go to the site, press extension’s button, and all correct answers will be highlighted.
