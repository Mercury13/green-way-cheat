# What is this?
A well-known Ukrainian traffic rules site has an achievement named “Faster than bullet”: complete exam in 30 seconds.

Ex-soviet theory exam consists of 20 questions, so 1.5 s per question is inhuman. And someone answered in 15 s, 0.75 s per question! That’s why I decided to cheat too.

**This cheat is just for your own entertainment.** Traffic rules sites give no legal advantages, and if you cheat, you won’t know rules and fail exam at National Police.
