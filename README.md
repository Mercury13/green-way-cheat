# What is this?
A well-known Ukrainian traffic rules site has an achievement named “Faster than bullet”: complete exam in 30 seconds.

Ex-soviet theory exam consists of 20 questions, so 1.5 s per question is inhuman. And someone answered in 15 s, 0.75 s per question! That’s why I decided to cheat too.

**This cheat is just for your own entertainment.** To get a license, you’ll still need to pass an exam in National Police, and if you cheat, you won’t know much.

# How does it work?
Works as a Firefox add-on, tested at 60.0.2 x64.

To install, type **about:debugging** in address bar, then choose **Load temporary add-on**.

Go to the site, press extension’s button, and all correct quesions will be highlighted.
